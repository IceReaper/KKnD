This repository contains the KKnD remake project based on the [OpenRA Mod SDK](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK).

Go to the archive with the game and install the engine files:

```
 ./fetch-engine.sh
```

If you have Ubuntu, you need to install the following packages:
```
sudo apt install mono-complete liblua5.1-0-dev libsdl2-2.0-0 libopenal1 curl
```

Next, make the engine:
```
make
```

Start the game:
```
./launch-game.sh
```
Then you will be offered to download the audio files, choose a quick installation.


Let's play :)
